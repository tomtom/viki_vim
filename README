This plugin adds wiki-like hypertext capabilities to Vim. You can use viki as 
a "minor" mode (i.e., as an add-on to any other mode) or as a full-fledged 
wiki mode. There is also an add-on plugin for "wikifying" latex documents by 
turning some latex commands into wiki names. If viki is properly configured, 
activating a reference to an image, a webpage etc. will view that resource in 
an external viewer.

From http://sourceforge.net/projects/deplate/ you can download a ruby based 
tool to convert viki markup to LaTeX, HTML, or DocBook. On its homepage 
(http://deplate.sf.net) you can read a more detailled specification of the 
markup.

markup.

MINOR WIKI MODE:
Just type |:VikiMinorMode| and all wiki names and URLs will be highlighted.  
When the cursor is over a wiki name, you can press <c-cr> to jump to (or 
create) the referred page (on a terminal use <LocalLeader>vf). Pressing 
<LocalLeader>vb brings you back to the original document. Alternatively, you 
can use <m-leftmouse> and <m-rightmouse> to jump back and forth. (NOTE: In 
minor mode, it's possible that viki words and URLs are not highlighted when 
they are included in some syntactic regions.)

FULL WIKI MODE:
In full mode, viki becomes a personal wiki 
(http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PersonalWiki). Set 'filetype' to viki or execute 
|:VikiMode|. The full wiki mode is like the minor mode but with folding 
support, syntax highlighting (for headings, lists, tables, textstyles etc.), 
and additional key bindings (i.e., you can press <c-tab> or <s-c-tab> to move 
the cursor to the next/previous viki name).

BUT HEY, WHAT IS A WIKI ANYWAY:
Among the vast amount of possible definitions, I prefer this one, which is my 
own anyway :-): a wiki is a simple way of creating hypertexts. In its basic 
form creating a hyperlink is as easy as writing a word in CamelCase (although 
this sometimes turn out to be more annoying than useful) or by a rather 
minimalist markup -- in the case of viki, this would be [[destination]] or 
[-destination-].

You begin by creating a directory where your wiki files should go to and by 
creating a wiki index -- a master file that contains references to sub-pages. 
After a while you end up with many small, tightly interlinked files/notes.

Wikis also come with a rather subtle markup. Here is a simple comparison of 
two examples of LaTeX and viki markup so that you get the idea of what it 
looks like:

    LaTeX: \section{Title}
    Viki:  * Title

    LaTeX: \emph{text}
    Viki:  __text__

And some wikis provide tools for translating this markup to other formats 
(like viki does in the form of the "deplate" program, which can translate viki 
markup to LaTeX, HTML, and Docbook). Unfortunately, about every wiki has its 
own markup.
